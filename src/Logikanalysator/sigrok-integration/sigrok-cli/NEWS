0.4.0 (2013-05-04)
------------------

 * Update sigrok-cli to the new APIs from both libsigrok 0.2.0 and also
   libsigrokdecode 0.2.0.
 * Add support for handling analog data sources (DMMs, scopes, dataloggers).
 * Bugfix in the handling of -A options with arguments.
 * Updated build dependencies list.
   - glib (required): Now must be >= 2.28.0.
   - libsigrok (required): Now must be >= 0.2.0.
   - libsigrokdecode (required): Now must be >= 0.2.0.
 * Add support for specifying input format options.
 * Probe numbers now generally start at 0 (not 1).
 * Command line option changes:
   - The -D|--list-devices option was renamed to --scan.
   - The -d|--device option was renamed to -c|--config.
   - The -a|--protocol-decoders option was renamed to -P|--protocol-decoders.
   - The -s|--protocol-decoder-stack option was renamed to
     -S|--protocol-decoder-stack.
   - Added a --driver option to specify which libsigrok driver is to be used.
   - Added a --show option. This can show details about drivers or PDs.
   - Added a --frames option which limits the number of frames to get from
     a supported oscilloscope (or other frame-based device).
 * Various documentation updates (README, manpage, and so on).
 * configure: Don't overwrite CFLAGS, but rather amend it.

0.3.1 (2012-05-30)
------------------

 * Add a ChangeLog file to the tarball.
 * -V option: If "-l 3" or higher is used, the PD description is shown, too.
 * -a option: Print optional/required PD probes. Example: sigrok-cli -a uart.
 * Fix compiling with "Homebrew" (Mac OS X).
 * Stacking order doesn't have to be specified if it's the same as the
   PD list. Example: sigrok-cli -i <file.sr> -a i2c,edid -s i2c,edid.
   The -s option is no longer required in this special case.
 * Only output module or PD output goes to stdout, everything else to stderr.
 * Improved error handling: Stop sigrok-cli upon various PD related errors.
 * New -A | --protocol-decoder-annotations option which allows the user to
   select which annotation types (and from which PD in the stack) to show.
 * Update the manpage.
 * Fix a Makefile.am bug which caused the generated ChangeLog files being
   accidentally deleted upon 'make distclean'.
