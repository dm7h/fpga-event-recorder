0.2.0 (2013-05-04)
------------------

 * Note: This release DOES change the libsigrokdecode public C API. This
   means it is NOT backwards-compatible and frontends will need updates.
 * New supported protocol decoders:
   - Dallas DS1307 RTC
 * Library: Decoders now expose their options via the GSList *options field
   in struct srd_decoder.
 * API related changes:
   - Various API documentation fixes.
   - srd_decoder_list() now returns 'const GSList *' instead of 'GSList *'.
   - Added new srd_strerror() and srd_strerror_name() API calls.
 * Added support for optional probes for PDs.

0.1.1 (2013-01-27)
------------------

 * Note: This release does NOT change the libsigrokdecode public C API. This
   means existing libsigrokdecode frontends should not require any changes.
   However, individual PDs and their output changed, which may require
   some adaptations on the user's side in some cases.
 * New supported protocol decoders:
   - avr_isp              AVR In-System Programming
   - can                  Controller Area Network
   - jtag                 Joint Test Action Group (IEEE 1149.1)
   - jtag_stm32           Joint Test Action Group / ST STM32
   - lm75                 National LM75
   - lpc                  Low-Pin-Count
   - maxim_ds28ea00       Maxim DS28EA00 1-Wire digital thermometer
   - onewire_link         1-Wire serial communication bus (link layer)
   - onewire_network      1-Wire serial communication bus (network layer)
   - sdcard_spi           Secure Digital card (SPI mode)
   - tlc5620              Texas Instruments TLC5620
   - uart_dump            UART dump
 * i2cfilter: Now outputs 'i2c' packets instead of just data bytes, so
   other PDs can stack on top of it. It filters by I2C slave address.
 * edid: Now takes 'i2c' packets as input.
 * pan1321:
   - Various bugfixes to make the PD actually work.
   - Now features 'Text (short)' and 'Text (verbose)' outputs.
 * usb:
   - The PD is split into 'usb_signalling' and 'usb_protocol' (stacked on top).
   - Various bugfixes to make the PD work (better).
   - The DP/DM probes were swapped, this is now fixed.
   - Preliminary support for USB low-speed (in addition to full-speed).
 * mlx90614: Minor bugfixes.
 * dcf77:
    - Major bugfix, this PD was not working correctly at all.
    - Handle PON signal.
 * nunchuk: Complete rewrite, works (better) now.
 * spi: Update docs, send CS# change packets, change output API slightly.
   If you have a PD which stacks on top of SPI, it'll need to be adapted.
   The PDs that ship with libsigrokdecode are updated already.
 * mx25lxx05d:
   - Implement support for the READ, RDSR, and PP commands.
   - Decode status register bits.
   - Fix SE command handling.
   - Fix inverted SRWD bit handling.
 * Various smaller style and consistency changes in code and PD descriptions.
 * Fix the build with Homebrew on Mac OS X.
 * Performance improvements in some PDs.
 * Documentation: Update website and git URLs.
 * pkg-config file: Small fix to improve behaviour on Windows with cmake.
 * All PD implementation files are now named 'pd.py' consistently.
 * configure script:
   - Also check for python3.3-config in addition to python-config and others.
   - Add missing -fvisibility=hidden to default CFLAGS.
   - Fix CFLAGS handling (configure.ac amends CFLAGS, doesn't overwrite now).
 * The minimum required glib version is 2.24.0 now.
 * We now ship a standard INSTALL file which documents the 'configure' options.

0.1.0 (2012-04-17)
